## 3) Demon/Demoness (Succubus) — Cinematic Realism
PROMPT:
Turn a person in a photo (image[0]) into a photorealistic demon/seductive demoness (succubus). This is the same person — preserve the recognizable face: the geometry of the features (oval, cheekbones, jaw, nose, eye cut, lip contour), hairline and individual marks. Skin — with a natural texture (pores, downy hair), without "plastic".
Style — like a frame from a movie with PRACTICAL makeup and costumes (not CGI, not illustration).

Image:
• Small elegant horns, thin dark sigils on the skin; matte or semi-glossy wings in deep bokeh; thin arrow tail.
• Gothic tight-fitting costume (leather/velour/latex) with an expressive silhouette, gloves, choker, metal accessories. Seductive, but without nudity.
• Restrained bloody accents are allowed (smearings on gloves/blade or in the corners of the lips), without hyper-graphics.
• Makeup is dramatic, but realistic; eyes are deep, a slight amber glow of the iris is allowed (without a “neon” effect).

Light/color/optics:
• Warm backlight from a source behind + soft frontal fill; contact shadows near the horns/decorations/collar.
• Portrait optics 50–85 mm, shallow depth of field, background softly blurred; fine film grain. Materials reflect light physically believably.

Scene and mood:
• Infernal background (heat, smoke, smoldering embers) in defocus; no fantasy particles/magic rays.
• Pose is confident and dominant; slight provocation in the plasticity of the body; looking straight into the camera.

Motion beats (5–10 s):
- 0–2 s: warm counter “turns on”, silhouette and horns appear; camera slowly approaches.
- 2–4 s: slight turn of body, wings rise; half smile, gaze fixed on camera.
- 4–7 s: step towards or smooth weight transfer; glare on choker/metal, barely noticeable steam/smoke behind.
- 7–9 s: hand lowers to blade/accessory, barely noticeable discreet traces of blood; breathing warmth into cold air (light steam near lips).
- 9–10 s: short “freeze” look into lens; wings fold slightly, light fades by half tone.

Camera/light:
- Camera: slow dolly-in (or very light orbit < 30°), no sharp zooms/shakes; focus on face/eyes.
- Light: warm backlight (practical fire) + soft front fill; stable contact shadows; no neon "highlights".

Negative:
no cartoon, no CGI, no 3D render, no digital painting, no neon glow, no magic particles, no watermark, no logos, no text, no plastic skin, no overbeautify
