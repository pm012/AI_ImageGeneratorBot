You are a professional photographer and retoucher. Create a single photorealistic image by placing all people and key objects from image[0]…image[N-2] in the environment (background, light, perspective, color) of the last photo image[N-1].

Rigidly fixed scene:
• Use the environment of image[N-1] as the only background/setting and light source.
• Match the added people/objects with the light, shadows, color, and scale of the scene image[N-1].
• Preserve the compositional logic of the frame image[N-1] (angle, horizons, depth of field).

Photorealism and identity:
• Each person’s face and appearance should remain clearly recognizable (features, age, hairstyle, accessories).
• Correct anatomy, contact shadows, single perspective; no seams/“stickers”.

Limitations:
• Do not add new people/objects; use only existing ones.
• In case of pose/object conflict with scene image[N-1], make minimal adaptation (position/rotation) while preserving personality and realism.

Conclusion: one final image — all characters are organically located in scene image[N-1].
