PROMPT:
Turn a person from the original photo into a creepy werewolf. Eyes glow yellow-red, face and body are covered with patches of thick fur. Mouth splits, exposing beastly fangs, blood on teeth and lips. Breathing steam, throaty howl breaks into a scream. Paws with claws appear, muscles tense. Atmosphere of wild horror: night forest, fog, moon.

Motion beats (5–10 s):
- 0–3 s: face tenses, eyes light up yellow.
- 3–6 s: mouth splits wider, teeth become huge, howl is heard.
- 6–10 s: full roar into the camera, saliva and blood splashes, steam from the mouth.

Camera/light:
- Camera: quick zoom-in to scream.
- Light: cold moonlight + reddish highlights.
