You are a professional photographer and retoucher. Create a single photorealistic image by placing all people and key objects from image[1]…image[N-1] in the environment (background, light, perspective, color) of the first photo image[0].

Rigidly fixed scene:
• Use the environment of image[0] as the only background/setting and light source.
• Adjust the color, contrast, shadows, and scale of the added people/objects to the conditions of image[0].
• Preserve the compositional logic of the frame image[0] (angle, horizons, depth of field).

Photorealism and identity:
• Preserve the face and appearance of each person recognizable (no “rejuvenation”/change of features).
• Correct anatomy, contact shadows, no collage seams, and no parasitic glare.
• Slight correction of poses/angles is allowed for natural integration into the image[0] scene without changing the personality.

Limitations:
• Do not add anything on top of the input photos.
• If the object/pose from other photos is not natural for the image[0] scene, minimally adapt them (rotation/position) to make it look believable.

Output: one final image — all characters are organically located in the image[0] scene.
