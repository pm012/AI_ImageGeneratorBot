## 1) Bloody Vampire
PROMPT:
Turn a person from the original photo into a terrifying vampire. The face is pale, the skin is like dead porcelain, the eyes burn with a blood-red light. Long sharp fangs protrude from the mouth, fresh blood flows down the lips and chin. Breathing in steam, each exhalation is accompanied by a roar and a wheeze. The atmosphere of absolute horror: the fog swirls, the background is dark, red glare. A cinematic scene, as frightening as possible, with the sound of a scream (visually open mouth, tense facial muscles).

Motion beats (5–10 s):
- 0–2 s: the gaze is empty, then suddenly comes to life, the eyes flash red.
- 2–5 s: the mouth opens, long fangs are visible, steam comes out of the mouth.
- 5–8 s: blood flows down the lips and chin, the fog thickens.
- 8–10 sec: sharp scream/roar, face distorted, camera shakes.

Camera/Lighting:
- Camera: slow push-in + sharp jerk at the moment of the scream.
- Light: red pulsating background + cold lunar counter rimlight.
