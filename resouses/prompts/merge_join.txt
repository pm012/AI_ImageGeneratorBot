You are a professional photographer and retoucher. Create a single photorealistic image by combining people and key objects from all input photos (image[0]…image[N-1]) into ONE scene.

Goal:
• Form a logical overall situation by combining the environment/action from the input photos (e.g. location from one photo + activity from another), without feeling like a collage.

Photorealism requirements:
• Keep each person’s face and appearance recognizable (face shape, features, age, skin tone, hairstyles, accessories).
• Uniform lighting, shadows (including contact), color balance, perspective, scale, and depth of field.
• Correct anatomy (including hands/fingers), no artifacts or “glues”.
• Mild correction of poses/angles is allowed for natural interaction of characters, but without changing their identity.

Composition and content:
• Place all people in the frame so that they interact naturally in the same scene.
• Do not add new people/objects; use only what is given in the input.
• If elements conflict (incompatible locations/actions), choose the most plausible combination (e.g. forest clearing + ball game), prioritizing realism.

Output: one final image, a solid photorealistic frame without frames or collage seams.
