## 4) Bloody Zombie
PROMPT:
Turn the person in the photo into a terrifying zombie. The skin is gray-green, covered with cracks, the eyes are cloudy with red veins. The mouth is open, broken fangs are visible, blood and pieces of flesh on the lips. From the mouth - wheezing, breathing in steam, drops of blood are flowing down. The atmosphere of absolute horror: fog, the moon is almost invisible, red glare on the face.

Motion beats (5–10 s):
- 0–3 s: eyes slowly open, cloudy, pupils barely move.
- 3–6 s: mouth opens wide, blood flows, wheezing is heard.
- 6–10 s: sharp jerk of the head towards the camera, loud scream, blood splashes.

Camera/light:
- Camera: sharp handheld shake at the moment of the scream.
- Light: red flashing background + cold contour.

Negative:
